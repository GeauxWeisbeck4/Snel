## What is Snel?

It is a `tool/framework` to compile .svelte component to javascript files to create web application using deno and svelte

## Main features

- simple setup
- quick compilation
- hot reloading
- support for scss and less out of the box
- support for typescript and sass out of the box (soon)

## What do I need to start using Snel?

the only thing you need is to run the installation command.

```console
deno run --allow-run https://deno.land/x/snel/install.ts
```

> wait wait! Why should I run a script instead of using deno install to install Snel?

Snel uses several tools to create a better development experience, some of these tools are:

- [**trex**](https://github.com/crewdevio/Trex) to handle scripts and compilation in watch mode.
- [**bundler**](https://deno.land/x/bundler) minify and package all files for production

the [install.ts](https://github.com/crewdevio/Snel/blob/main/install.ts) file is responsible for installing all these tools so that you only worry about creating your application.

## how to create a project with Snel?

after running the installation script you just have to run the create command:

```console
snel create [project name]
```

then you just have to enter the created project and start the development server

```console
cd ./[project name]

trex run start
```

this starts your application on a development server in the port you entered in the configuration

## Using svelte core libraries

to use svelte core libraries such as transition, store, motion etc. must be called using the following syntax:

```javascript
import { onMount } from "@svelte";
import { tweened } from "@svelte/motion";
import { cubicOut } from "@svelte/easing";
```

`@svelte` tells the compiler that svelte core resources are being accessed.

## Using svlc/svelte compiler

Snel uses the svelte compiler to transform the components to javacript, if you just want to use the compiler separately, we provide a compiler wrapper within a simple cli that you can install using deno install or transform it to an executable using deno compile.

`install compiler`

```
deno install -A --unstable https://deno.land/x/snel/compiler/svlc.ts
```

`transform to executable`

```
deno compile -A --unstable https://deno.land/x/snel/compiler/svlc.ts
```

If you are interested in using the low-level compiler tools, you only have to access the [compiler.ts](https://github.com/crewdevio/Snel/blob/main/compiler/compiler.ts) file, which is a bridge between the svelte compiler (already transformed to javascript see [core.js](https://github.com/crewdevio/Snel/blob/main/compiler/core.js)) which provides typing and useful interfaces when using the compiler core.

## Hot Reloading

Snel provides hot reload capability, it compiles and updates the application when changes are applied to it

`example`
